# Music Memory Game

A simple memory game where the player
must remember a sequence of sounds. There are four
types of sounds that can make up each sequence, and the
sequence length will start at one sound, adding one new sound
each time the player successfully remembers the sequence. This application is meant for anyone who would like to test their
memory or have a little bit of fun!
