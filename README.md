## Project Description: Memory Game

This application is a simple memory game where the player
must remember a sequence of sounds. There are four
types of sounds which will make up each sequence, and the
sequence length will start at one sound, adding one new sound
each time the player successfully remembers the sequence.

This application is meant for anyone who would like to test their
memory or have a little bit of fun. I chose to create this application
because I enjoy memory games and I also love music, and a sound-based
memory game allows me to mesh the two!

## User Stories

of length 1.

highest score.

end the game and add it to my list of total games if incorrect.
