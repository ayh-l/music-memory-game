# My Personal Project

## Project Description: Memory Game

This application will be a simple memory game where the player
will have to remember a sequence of sounds. There will be four
types of sounds which will make up each sequence, and the
sequence length will start at one sound, adding one new sound
each time the player successfully remembers the sequence. There
will also be a high-score feature and a history feature that
allows players to listen to their previous sequences.

This application is meant for anyone who would like to test their
memory or have a little bit of fun. I chose to create this application
because I enjoy memory games and I also love music, and a sound-based
memory game allows me to mesh the two!

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to start a new game with a sequence
of length 1.
- As a user, I want to be able to view my total games played, my
highest score, and a chart showing how my daily average score
is changing.
- As a user, (during a game) I want to be able to enter a sequence of
defined sounds and receive the next sequence of sounds if correct, or
end the game and add it to my list of total games if incorrect.
- As a user, I want to be able to select a past game from my list of
total games and play back the final sequence.
